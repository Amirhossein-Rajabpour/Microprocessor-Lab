# Microprocessor-Lab

## About Microprocessor and Assembly Language course
In this course, for better understanding of how microcontrollers function we worked with Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller. In the second half of the course we worked with ARM assembly language. 

## About Lab
In this Lab, codes are written in arduino language and are simulated in proteus. Each session is in a separate folder with its codes, screenshots from the simulation, its report and also its proteus files (which have .pdsprj format).


## About Projects 
There are also two mini projects ( [safebox](https://github.com/amirhoseinRj/Microprocessor-Lab/tree/main/S6-SafeBox) and [electric jacob](https://github.com/amirhoseinRj/Microprocessor-Lab/tree/main/S6-Yaghoob%20Barghi)) and a [final project](https://github.com/amirhoseinRj/Microprocessor-Lab/tree/main/Final%20Project) (which is about controling the tempreture of a reaction tank).
